					<a href="#" class="float-right">18 June, 2023</a>
					<p>The Riemann zeta function, denoted by ζ(s), is a mathematical function that was introduced by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century. It is defined for complex numbers s with real part greater than 1 and is extended to other values using analytic continuation.

The Riemann zeta function is defined by the infinite series:

ζ(s) = 1^(-s) + 2^(-s) + 3^(-s) + 4^(-s) + ...

where the terms represent the reciprocals of the natural numbers raised to the power of s.

One of the main reasons the Riemann zeta function is of significant interest is because of its connection to prime numbers. Riemann proposed the Riemann Hypothesis, which states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on a certain line in the complex plane called the critical line. The Riemann Hypothesis remains an unsolved problem in mathematics, and its resolution would have profound implications for number theory.

The Riemann zeta function has various important properties and applications in mathematics. It has connections to complex analysis, number theory, and physics. It is often used in calculations involving the distribution of prime numbers, the study of sums of powers, and the evaluation of certain integrals.

There are many other zeta functions that are related to the Riemann zeta function, such as the Dirichlet zeta function and the Hurwitz zeta function, which have similar properties but different ranges of convergence and applications.

Overall, the Riemann zeta function is a fundamental mathematical function that plays a significant role in number theory and has connections to various areas of mathematics.</p>
